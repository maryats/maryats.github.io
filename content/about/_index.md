## Marie Yatsyk
#### developer // designer // artist

Hello! I'm a creative coder who is passionate about building useful things and designing clean, intuitive user interfaces.

I work as a software engineer at Google, building hotel search features in the Google Maps Android app.
I also have experience in marketing, digital analytics, and design.

In my free time you can catch me digging in the garden, working on my next crafting project, or running. ðŸŒ¿
