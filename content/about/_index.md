## Marie Yatsyk
#### web developer / designer / artist

Hello! I'm a creative coder who is passionate about web development and designing clean, intuitive user interfaces.

I also have over four years of experience in marketing, digital analytics, design, and software development.
I'm currently completing my senior year at Northeastern University as a Computer Science and Interaction Design major.

Until then, in my free time you can catch me sketching on the T, wandering through nature, or running.
