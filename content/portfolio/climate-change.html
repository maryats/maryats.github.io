  <p>This dramatic poster uses data from <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/climate-change.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">climate.nasa.gov</a> to showcase evidence of climate change, with a focus on melting polar ice caps.</p>

  <p>I created this poster for the <i>Typography II</i> course at Northeastern University.</p>
