            <p><i>Shout Your Worth</i> is a game-like toolkit to help you communicate your value. It teaches
                the <strong>value statement</strong> format for talking about their accomplishments — which is a proven
                technique taught in salary negotiation workshops put on by the <a href="https://www.aauw.org/">AAUW</a>.

            <p><i>Shout Your Worth</i> was created for the Interaction Design Senior Capstone team project at
                Northeastern University.</p>

                Players craft value statements using <strong>Accomplishment</strong>, <strong>Skill</strong>, and
                <strong>Result</strong> cards, then share real-world experiences that illustrate those value statements.
                Collaborative gameplay creates a supportive, encouraging environment for players to practice this
                self-advocacy skill.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Our team created a Medium publication to document our process for this two semester-long project. Check
                it out!</p>

            <h3>A "Wicked Problem"</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12">

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>We surveyed working professionals and fellow college students to learn about their experiences
                negotiating for their salary, and the gender wage gap. Something that really stood out to us was the
                polarized attitude toward negotiation — it seemed that there was a <a
                    href="https://www.gendereconomy.org/addressing-the-gender-confidence-gap/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">confidence gap</a> that wasn't being addressed by existing solutions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
            <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*lD5IyoC7pXBC0ZLeP5rRFw.png">
            <p>Those who didn't plan to negotiate said things like:</p>
            <blockquote>“I don’t feel like I’m qualified or confident enough.”<br />“…I feel like I won’t have any
                leverage to negotiate.”</blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
            <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*y-v8H0kUrPxdimv1usaGFQ.png">
            <p>While those who did were confident about doing so:</p>
            <blockquote>“I know my skills are valuable and it’s always worth asking... I don’t know why you wouldn’t
                negotiate.”</blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p>After researching existing solutions for teaching salary negotiation, we found a gap that we could
                fill.
                Our solution would meet women where they are and encourage them to practice negotiation skills in a
                low
                pressure environment – what better way to do that than with a game?</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8">
            <h3>Values-based Game Design</h3>
            <p>Our research inspired us to make a solution that would make people feel more confident about
                advocating for themselves, to help bridge the gap we saw in survey responses. </p>
            <blockquote class="pullquote">How can we create a chain reaction of education and empowerment by
                encouraging
                women to
                confidently discuss salary, negotiation and resources in a comfortable environment?</blockquote>
            <p>Following the principles of value-driven design we learned from
                <a href="https://www.valuesatplay.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Values at
                    Play</a>,
                we identified the key values and concepts we wanted our game to embody.</p>

                friendly,
                celebratory, visual language that uses lovingly-crafted watercolor textures and patterns for a
                hand-crafted touch.
