            <p><i>Shout Your Worth</i> is a game-like toolkit to help you communicate your value. It teaches
                the <strong>value statement</strong> format for talking about their accomplishments — which is a proven
                technique taught in <a href="https://www.aauw.org/">AAUW</a> salary negotiation workshops.

            <p><i>Shout Your Worth</i> was created for the Interaction Design Senior Capstone team project at

                Players craft value statements using <strong>Accomplishment</strong>, <strong>Skill</strong>, and
                <strong>Result</strong> cards, then share real-world experiences that illustrate those value statements.

                Collaborative gameplay creates a supportive, encouraging environment for players to practice this
                self-advocacy skill.

            <h3>A "Wicked Problem"</h3>
            <p>Our capstone class was encouraged to solve a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wicked problem</a>. We chose the
                <strong>gender wage gap</strong>, and found that it is mainly perpetuated at crossroads in a
                woman's career, like:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>First entering the workforce</li>
                <li>Negotiating a promotion</li>
                <li>Returning from a leave of absence after caring for children or family</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We decided to focus our solution on the common thread of <strong>negotiation</strong> and self-advocacy.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>We surveyed working professionals and fellow college students about their experiences with salary
                negotiation and the gender wage gap. Looking at the responses, the
                polarized attitude toward negotiation really stood out to us.

            <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*lD5IyoC7pXBC0ZLeP5rRFw.png">
            <p>Those who didn't plan to negotiate said things like:</p>
            <blockquote>“I don’t feel like I’m qualified or confident enough.”<br />“…I feel like I won’t have any
                leverage to negotiate.”</blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
            <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*y-v8H0kUrPxdimv1usaGFQ.png">
            <p>While those who did were confident about doing so:</p>
            <blockquote>“I know my skills are valuable and it’s always worth asking... I don’t know why you wouldn’t
                negotiate.”</blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <p>After <a href="https://medium.com/shout-your-worth/research-e6c35a7190f1">researching existing
                    solutions</a> for teaching salary negotiation, we found a that most of them were
                too stuffy or business-oriented to address this <a
                    href="https://www.gendereconomy.org/addressing-the-gender-confidence-gap/">confidence gap</a>. We
                resolved to create a solution would meet women where they are and encourage them to practice negotiation
                skills in a low pressure environment — what better way to do that than a game?</p>

            <h3>Values-based Game Design</h3>
            <p>Our research inspired us to make a solution that would make people feel more confident about
                advocating for themselves, to help bridge the gap we saw in survey responses. </p>
            <blockquote class="pullquote">How can we create a chain reaction of education and empowerment by
                encouraging women to confidently discuss salary, negotiation and resources in a comfortable environment?
            </blockquote>
            <p>Following the principles of value-driven design we learned from
                <a href="https://www.valuesatplay.org/">Values at Play</a>,
                we identified the key values and concepts we wanted our game to embody.</p>

            <h3>Visual Design</h3>
            <p>To appeal to our target audience of women at crossroads in their careers, we created a clean,
                friendly, celebratory, visual language that uses lovingly-crafted watercolor textures and patterns for a
                hand-crafted touch. Our team met bi-weekly to critique each others' work.</p>
