      <p>I created an interactive sculpture inspired by this quote:
        <blockquote>When one door closes, another opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed
          door that we do not see the one which has opened for us.
          <cite>â€” Alexander Graham Bell</cite></blockquote>

      <p>This quote felt very relevant to my senior semester of college, and I wanted to create a playful piece that
        invited audiences to interact and engage with it while being self-reflective.</p>
      <p>The digital design was done using <a href="https://www.sketchup.com" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">SketchUp</a>, then
        fabricated using a laser cutter for my final project for the 3D Fundamentals course at Northeastern University.

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>Although this was my first time working in 3D, I was able to apply my usual design process.</p>
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>This sculpture was mainly inspired by the works of Arthur Ganson, Theo Jansen, Alexander Calder, Chuck
        Hoberman, Ivan Black, and Dukno Yoon.</p>

      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
      <p>The design for this sculpture went through a number of iterations, driven by a series of prototypes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
      <img src="concept.gif">
      <p>My original concept sketch involved a chaotic tower of interconnected doors.</p>

      <p>Engineering the pulley-hinge took some thinking, and I took some inspiration from the <a

          target="_blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">"Another Door"</a> sculpture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
      <img src="prototype-pulleys.jpg">
      <p>This hinge prototype revealed that the doors needed supports so that they wouldn't wobble when opened.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
      <img src="model-concept.png">
      <p>Translating the sketch into a digital model showed that "floating" doors are tricky.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
      <img src="model-circle.png">
      <p>I simplified the design to be a single-level ring of interconnected doors.</p>

      <p>Each door has a unique design inspired by doors from around Boston.</p>

      <h3>Fabrication</h3>
      <p>The thickness of each piece of wood was incorporated into the final design, so that each part fits snugly
        together for a
        press fit.</p>

      <h3>Presentation</h3>
      <p>I designed a poster that gives an overview of the design process behind the piece.</p>
