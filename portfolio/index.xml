      <description>In Fall 2018, I worked as a Studio Developer for Scout. In three months, our five-person student team (three designers, two developers) created a new brand identity and assets, packaging, a brand book, and a fully-functional marketing and e-commerce website for our client – a young granola bar company started by a Northeastern alumna.  For the first half of the semester I focused on user experience design, helping create lo-fi packaging and website wireframes in addition to conducting user research and iterating on logo designs.</description>

      <description>TripKick is a travel sidekick app that helps streamline the trip-planning process from research to on-the-go.
Users start by collecting information about hotels, flights trip destinations in a browser extension / web application. From there, they can create a trip itinerary, and install the TripKick mobile app.
In the time leading up to the trip, TripKick notifies users of dropped prices and discounts for their travel plans.
 During the trip, the app helps users navigate to their destinations, review attractions on TripAdvisor, and find alternate activities in case events get rained out or change hours unexpectedly.</description>

      <description>This dramatic poster uses data from climate.nasa.gov to showcase evidence of climate change, with a focus on melting polar ice caps.
When I learned about global warming as a kid, I remember feeling a powerful urgency to try and change things. I tried to create an attention-grabbing poster that would both inform viewers and get them equally concerned about this issue.</description>

      <description>For a Typography II assignment, I designed these book covers for a hypothetical series for the Canadian Center of Architecture about three influential architects: Louis Sullivan, Richard Neutra, and Frank Gehry.
 I wanted to showcase the unique aspects of each architect&#39;s works, and for this I drew inspiration from the architects&#39; drafting sketches, which give an fascinating glimpse into their thought process.

      <description>Title screen art by R. Giraud     During the 2017 Global Game Jam, I worked on a team with six other students to build a video game from scratch in 48 hours.  We created Spooky FM, a 2D side-scrolling survival game where you play as a radio DJ who tries to appease an influx of monsters by playing their favorite music. Battle your station’s awful WiFI connection and your own caffeine dependency while making sure to fulfill audience requests to keep the ratings up!</description>

      <description>MindSet is a mood and habit tracking web app that aims to help users manage their stress by allowing them to track their weekly schedule (calendar data), to-do lists, and habits as well as other factors that affect their mood (such as exercise, amount of sleep, caffeine intake, etc.).
Based on that data, the app makes suggestions for what the user should do each week to help improve their mood (ex: take a 20 minute nap on certain days, limit caffeine to no more than 2 cups a day, sit in the sun)</description>

      <description>This print was inspired by a passage in Thomas Hardy’s Return of the Native. It describes the lone figure of Eustacia Vye standing silhouetted on a barrow, while in the distance the other villages light bonfires, one by one, all across the heath.   This project was my first foray into linoleum printmaking, and it enabled me to play around with different color combinations as a way of conveying different atmospheres.</description>
