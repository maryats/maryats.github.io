      <description>This poster was created for the information design class at Northeastern University. The goal was to show a process that had at least 10 steps, using as few words as possible. I used watercolors to illustrate each step of the process.

      <description>TripKick is a travel sidekick app that helps streamline the trip-planning process from research to on-the-go.
Users start by collecting information about hotels, flights trip destinations in a browser extension / web application. From there, they can create a trip itinerary, and install the TripKick mobile app.
In the time leading up to the trip, TripKick notifies users of dropped prices and discounts for their travel plans.
 During the trip, the app helps users navigate to their destinations, review attractions on TripAdvisor, and find alternate activities in case events get rained out or change hours unexpectedly.</description>

      <description>This dramatic poster uses data from climate.nasa.gov to showcase evidence of climate change, with a focus on melting polar ice caps.
When I learned about global warming as a kid, I remember feeling a powerful urgency to try and change things. I tried to create an attention-grabbing poster that would both inform viewers and get them equally concerned about this issue.</description>

      <description>For a Typography II assignment, I designed these book covers for a hypothetical series for the Canadian Center of Architecture about three influential architects: Louis Sullivan, Richard Neutra, and Frank Gehry.
 I wanted to showcase the unique aspects of each architect&#39;s works, and for this I drew inspiration from the architects&#39; drafting sketches, which give an fascinating glimpse into their thought process.

      <description>MindSet is a mood and habit tracking web app that aims to help users manage their stress by allowing them to track their weekly schedule (calendar data), to-do lists, and habits as well as other factors that affect their mood (such as exercise, amount of sleep, caffeine intake, etc.).
Based on that data, the app makes suggestions for what the user should do each week to help improve their mood (ex: take a 20 minute nap on certain days, limit caffeine to no more than 2 cups a day, sit in the sun)</description>
