      <description>TripKick is a travel sidekick app that helps streamline the trip-planning process from research to on-the-go.
Users start by collecting information about hotels, flights trip destinations in a browser extension / web application. From there, they can create a trip itinerary, and install the TripKick mobile app.
In the time leading up to the trip, TripKick notifies users of dropped prices and discounts for their travel plans.
During the trip, the app helps users navigate to their destinations, review attractions on TripAdvisor, and find alternate activities in case events get rained out or change hours unexpectedly.</description>
