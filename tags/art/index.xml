      <description>I created an interactive sculpture inspired by this quote: When one door closes, another opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us. — Alexander Graham Bell  I wanted to create a piece that would illustrate Bell&#39;s quote, and that audiences could interact and play with. I designed the sculpture using SketchUp and fabricated it using a laser cutter, which I learned how to use as part of the 3D Fundamentals course at Northeastern University.</description>

      <description>For the 2019 Global Game Jam, I worked on a team with six other students to build a video game from scratch in 48 hours.  This year&#39;s theme was &#34;Home&#34;, and we were inspired by the idea of apartment buildings, where so many strangers live in close proximity but many of whom never even meet. We created In Good Spirits, a 2D puzzle game where you play as a ghost haunting an apartment building.</description>

      <description>This poster was created for the information design class at Northeastern University. We were asked to show a process with at least 10 steps, using as few words as possible. I used watercolors to illustrate each step of the process.

      <description>Title screen art by R. Giraud     During the 2017 Global Game Jam, I worked on a team with six other students to build a video game from scratch in 48 hours.  We created Spooky FM, a 2D side-scrolling survival game where you play as a radio DJ who tries to appease an influx of monsters by playing their favorite music. Battle your station’s awful WiFI connection and your own caffeine dependency while making sure to fulfill audience requests to keep the ratings up!</description>

      <description> This interactive narrative was created in response to the prompt &#34;elicit an emotion.&#34; I chose to explore the sensation of social anxiety. I also wanted to challenge myself to see if I could create a sense of unease and discomfort through very simple ASCII art-like illustrations.   Experience the story   </description>

      <description>A portrait of one of my favorite musicians: Dessa.
      -- -- --   -- -- -- Each flower was meticulously drawn using tiny straight lines, as a challenge in using the Adobe Illustrator pen tool without drawing curves.

      <description>This print was inspired by a passage in Thomas Hardy’s Return of the Native. It describes the lone figure of Eustacia Vye standing silhouetted on a barrow, while in the distance the other villages light bonfires, one by one, all across the heath.   This project was my first foray into linoleum printmaking, and it enabled me to play around with different color combinations as a way of conveying different atmospheres.</description>
