      <description>Shout Your Worth is a game-like toolkit to help people communicate their value. It teaches the value statement format for talking about one&#39;s accomplishments, which is a proven technique taught in AAUW salary negotiation workshops. Shout Your Worth was created for my Interaction Design capstone project at Northeastern University.
ShoutYourWorth.com Players craft value statements using Accomplishment, Skill, and Result cards, then share real-world experiences that illustrate those value statements. Collaborative gameplay creates a supportive, encouraging environment for players to practice this self-advocacy skill.</description>

      <description>I created an interactive sculpture inspired by this quote: When one door closes, another opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us. — Alexander Graham Bell This quote felt very relevant to my senior semester of college, and I wanted to create a playful piece that invited audiences to interact and engage with it while being self-reflective.</description>

      <description>In Fall 2018, I worked as a Studio Developer for Scout. In four months, our five-person student team (three designers, two developers) created a new brand identity and assets, packaging, a brand book, and a fully-functional marketing and e-commerce website for our client – a young granola bar company started by a Northeastern alumna. For the first half of the semester I focused on user experience design, helping create lo-fi packaging and website wireframes in addition to conducting user research and iterating on logo designs.</description>

      <description>TripKick is a travel sidekick app that helps streamline the trip-planning process from research to on-the-go.
Users start by collecting information about hotels, flights trip destinations in a browser extension / web application. From there, they can create a trip itinerary, and install the TripKick mobile app.
In the time leading up to the trip, TripKick notifies users of dropped prices and discounts for their travel plans.
During the trip, the app helps users navigate to their destinations, review attractions on TripAdvisor, and find alternate activities in case events get rained out or change hours unexpectedly.</description>

      <description>This dramatic poster uses data from climate.nasa.gov to showcase evidence of climate change, with a focus on melting polar ice caps.
When I learned about global warming as a kid, I remember feeling a powerful urgency to try and change things. I tried to create an attention-grabbing poster that would both inform viewers and get them equally concerned about this issue.
I created this poster for the Typography II course at Northeastern University.</description>

      <description>These book covers are for a hypothetical series about three influential architects. I designed them for the Typography II course at Northeastern University.
I wanted to showcase the unique aspects of each architect&#39;s works, and for this I drew inspiration from the architects&#39; drafting sketches, which give an fascinating glimpse into their thought process.</description>

      <description>MindSet is a mood and habit tracking web app that helps users manage their stress by allowing them to track their weekly schedule (calendar data), to-do lists, habits, and other factors that affect their mood (such as exercise, amount of sleep, caffeine intake, etc.).
Based on that data, the app makes suggestions for what the user should do each week to help improve their mood, such as: take a 20 minute nap on certain days, limit caffeine intake, sit in the sun, etc.</description>

      <description>Promotional Flyers From January-December 2016, I wrote and designed the flyers for the Northeastern University Marketing Association&#39;s (NUMA) weekly meetings. I also designed matching social media graphics for Facebook events, Instagram posts, and website banners.
Logo Design In fall 2016, I re-designed the logo for the Northeastern University Marketing Association to help with their re-branding on campus. The new logo projects a polished and bold image, but also retains the approachability of the old logo through the rounded letterforms.</description>
