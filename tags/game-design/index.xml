      <description>For the 2019 Global Game Jam, I worked on a team with six other students to build a video game from scratch in 48 hours.

We created Spooky FM, a 2D side-scrolling survival game where you play as a radio DJ who tries to appease an influx of monsters by playing their favorite music. Battle your stationâ€™s awful WiFI connection and your own caffeine dependency while making sure to fulfill audience requests to keep the ratings up!</description>
