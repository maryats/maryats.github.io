      <description>Shout Your Worth is a game-like toolkit to help you communicate your value. It teaches the value statement format for talking about their accomplishments â€” which is a proven technique taught in AAUW salary negotiation workshops.  Shout Your Worth was created for the Interaction Design Senior Capstone team project at Northeastern University.
 ShoutYourWorth.com       Players craft value statements using Accomplishment, Skill, and Result cards, then share real-world experiences that illustrate those value statements.</description>

      <description>For a Typography II assignment, I designed these book covers for a hypothetical series for the Canadian Center of Architecture about three influential architects: Louis Sullivan, Richard Neutra, and Frank Gehry.
 I wanted to showcase the unique aspects of each architect&#39;s works, and for this I drew inspiration from the architects&#39; drafting sketches, which give an fascinating glimpse into their thought process.
