      <description>This abstract sculpture was inspired by the movement of starling murmurations. It was created as an assignment for the 3D Fundamentals course at Northeastern University.   Process For inspiration, I watched the video below on repeat and sketched the abstract forms of the flying birds. I then carved my favorite sketch into floral foam, after which I used a 3D scanner to digitize the sculpture, and sliced it into 52 pieces for the laser cutter using SketchUp.</description>

      <description>I created an interactive sculpture inspired by this quote: When one door closes, another opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us. â€” Alexander Graham Bell  This quote felt very relevant to my senior semester of college, and I wanted to create a playful piece that invited audiences to interact and engage with it while being self-reflective.</description>
